# Data-Analyst-for-Enterprise
Data Analyst for Enterprise Nanodegree by Bertelsmann &amp; Udacity

Learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, make predictions using machine learning, and clearly
communicate critical findings.

## Project 1:Explore Weather Trends

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

## Project 2: Investigate a Dataset

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project 4: Data Wrangling

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

## Project 5: Communicate Data Findings

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
